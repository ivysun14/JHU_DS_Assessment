## Q1
![Death roll by year](Q1.png)

The scatterplot shows the number of people estimated to have died in the deadliest natural disasters by year over time, from around 1900 to 2025. 
Each dot represents a specific disaster, with its position on the x-axis representing the year it occurred, and the height on the y-axis showing the number of deaths.
For example, the dot with the highest position on the y-axis represents the China flood in 1931, with an estimated number of death over 2,000,000 people. 
The color of each dot indicates the type of disaster, such as earthquake, flood, or cyclone. Most disasters resulted in around 100,000 deaths, as can be seen by majority of dots
concentrating at the bottom of the plot. However, a few disasters had extremely high death tolls, especially one event in the 1930s that caused over 2 million deaths (1931 China flood).
Earthquakes and tropical cyclones are frequently the most deadliest natural disasters in each year, reflected by the abundance of dots colored in red and blue from the plot.

## Q2
The learning rate controls the time the algorithm needs to reach convergence. The algorithm shows slower convergence when the learning rate is extremely low, and faster convergence when the
learning rate falls in a reasonable range.

The algorithm could fail under numerical instability caused by overly large learning rate.
